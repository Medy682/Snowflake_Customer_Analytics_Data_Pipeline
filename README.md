Customer Analytics Data Pipeline

Author: Kidima Medy Masuka 

Date: 2026


✔ Project Overview

The Customer Data Analytics Pipeline is an end-to-end ELT data engineering solution designed to ingest, process, and analyze customer sales data using a modern cloud data stack. 
I designed and deployed this Snowflake ELT pipeline with GitHub Actions CI/CD, implementing idempotent SQL scripts and RSA Key-Pair authentication to ensure 100% automated deployment reliability.

🏗️ Architecture & Flow

The pipeline leverages Snowflake as the cloud data warehouse. Data is extracted from CSV sources, ingested into a Raw Layer, and progressively transformed through a Staging Layer (cleaning and preparation) and an Analytics Layer. 
The Final Analytics Layer utilizes Dimensional Modelling (Star Schema) to support business reporting and actionable insights.

🛠️ Core Engineering Practices

➡ Idempotency: Implemented "If Not Exists" logic and standardized object creation to resolve "Object Already Exists" compilation errors, ensuring scripts can run repeatedly without failure.

➡ Dimensional Modelling: Designed a robust Star Schema in the Analytics layer to optimize query performance and reporting.

➡ Orchestration: Automated and scheduled complex workflows using Azure Data Factory (ADF) for end-to-end pipeline management.

➡ CI/CD Success: Developed a fully automated deployment trigger via GitHub Actions, handling everything from schema updates to data loading.

➡ Reliability: Built a multi-layered validation strategy with comprehensive logging for error handling and Incremental Loading to ensure fault tolerance and data integrity.

🏆 Key Achievement

Successfully resolved environment-specific SQL compilation errors by standardizing object creation scripts and optimizing path-sensitive workflows, 
achieving a seamless, "green-light" automated deployment


 🚀 Key Features

- End-to-end ELT pipeline using Snowflake
- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Azure Data Factory orchestration

✔ Architecture

The pipeline follows a layered ELT architecture, where raw data is ingested first, and transformations are performed inside the data warehouse.

✔ Data Pipeline Layers

🔰 Raw Layer

The Raw Layer stores ingested datasets in their original format.

Purpose:

• Preserve source data
• Enable data lineage tracking
• Provide reproducibility for transformations

Tables in this layer mirror the structure of the source CSV files.


🔰 Staging Layer

The Staging Layer prepares the raw data for transformation and modeling.

Key operations include:

• Data cleaning
• Schema standardization
• Data type corrections

This layer ensures the data is standardized before analytics modeling. 


🔰 Data Quality Layer

The data quality layer validates the integrity of the data.

Validation checks include:

Null value detection
Duplicate record identification
Schema validation
Data consistency checks

These checks ensure that only reliable and trustworthy data progresses into the Analytics Layer.


🔰 Analytics Layer

The Analytics Layer contains the Final Analytical data model optimized for reporting and insights.

The Analytics Layer implements a dimensional star schema consisting of:

Fact Table:
fact_sales

Dimension Tables:
dim_customer
dim_products
dim_date

This modeling approach simplifies Analytical queries and improves query performance.

🔰 Analytical Views

On top of the dimensional model, several Analytical views were created to answer key business questions.

Examples include:

✅ Sales by country
✅ Sales by category
✅ Sales by date
✅ Top customers by revenue
✅ Number of orders per customer
✅ Average order value per customer
✅ Top 5 best-selling products
✅ Quantity sold per product
✅ Yearly sales trends
✅ Year-over-year sales change

A global KPI summary view was also created to provide high-level business metrics.

✔ Pipeline Orchestration

Pipeline orchestration is implemented using Azure Data Factory.

Azure Data Factory is responsible for:

• Scheduling pipeline execution
• Automating SQL transformation workflows
• Managing pipeline dependencies
• Running the pipeline in the cloud


✔ The orchestrated pipeline executes the following workflow:

Load Raw Data
        ↓
Run Staging Transformations
        ↓
Run Data Quality Checks
        ↓
Build Fact Table
        ↓
Build Dimension Tables
        ↓
Create Analytics Views


This ensures the pipeline runs automatically without manual intervention.


✔ CI/CD Automation

The project implements Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions.

The CI/CD workflow automatically:

• Validates SQL scripts
• Runs pipeline checks
• Tests data transformations
• Detects errors before deployment

This ensures that changes to the pipeline code or SQL transformations are tested before being integrated.

✔ Testing and Validation

The tests/ directory contains SQL scripts for output verification. This final stage ensures data integrity across all Analytics tables and views post-execution
These tests check for:

• Null values in critical columns
• Duplicate records
• Expected row counts
• Table integrity

✅ The multi-layered validation strategy talked about earlier goes as follows:

🔰 In_pipeline_validation (data quality checks within the DQ Layer inside the pipeline)

🔰 Pre-deployment validation (CI/CD implementation through GitHub Actions workflow)

🔰 Post_execution_validation ( reconciliation and output checks to ensure data accuracy after pipeline execution) 


These three validation layers collectively form a data reliability engineering framework, widely adopted in modern data platforms


These validations ensure that the pipeline maintains strong data quality standards.

Configuration Management

✔ Pipeline configurations are stored in a dedicated configuration folder.

This includes:

• Pipeline settings
• Environment variables
• YAML configuration files

Separating configuration from code improves maintainability and scalability.

Monitoring & Observability

Pipeline monitoring is supported through logging tables that capture pipeline errors and execution metadata.

These logs allow engineers to audit pipeline execution and diagnose failures.
This modular structure ensures the project remains organized, scalable, and easy to maintain.

Python Automation 

While a Python-based automation layer could be integrated into this workflow, it is considered an optional enhancement for this specific project.
This Layer was intentionally excluded to maintain a streamlined architecture, as Python automation typically serves more advanced requirements, such as: 

• pipeline monitoring
• automated deployments
• advanced data ingestion
• API integrations

Since the pipeline already includes SQL transformations, Azure Data Factory orchestration, and CI/CD automation, the core objectives of the project were completed without requiring Python automation.

✔ Summary

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a modern ELT data engineering pipeline using:

• Snowflake for data warehousing
• Azure Data Factory for orchestration
• GitHub Actions for CI/CD
• SQL for data transformation and modeling

By combining layered architecture, dimensional modeling, automated workflows, and data quality validation, the pipeline represents a scalable and production-ready framework for customer data analytics.
